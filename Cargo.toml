# Managing dependencies on crates from starkware-libs/cairo repository:
#
# The Cairo compiler is made of a bunch of crates that inter-depend on each other and have
# synchronised versioning.
# It is very important to use a single revision of these crates in the entire Cairo toolchain,
# which consists of Cairo compiler, Scarb, CairoLS and other tools.
# The toolchain is eventually built by Scarb, which depends on everything other as regular crates.
# To ensure that all crates in the toolchain use the same revision of Cairo crates, we use a patch
# mechanism that Cargo provides.
# Because Cargo requires patches to change the crate source, we have an unspoken contract that
# all tools *always* depend on some crates.io versions of Cairo crates and Scarb uses
# [patch.crates.io] table to set final git revision for everything.
#
# To keep our Cargo.toml following this contract, always use `cargo xtask upgrade`
# for manipulating these dependencies.

# Here we specify real dependency specifications for Cairo crates *if* currently we want to use
# a particular unreleased commit (which is frequent mid-development).
# We list all Cairo crates that go into Scarb's compilation unit even if Scarb itself does not depend
# on some of them directly.
# This ensures no duplicate instances of Cairo crates are pulled in by mistake.
